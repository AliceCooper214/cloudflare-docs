Privacy Gateway improves the privacy of end-users reaching an application by [proxying HTTP requests](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/) through our network. We take this seriously and will do everything we can to protect the privacy of user’s data relayed through this service.

The Privacy Gateway service follows [Cloudflare’s privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/). In addition, we promise the following:

- We will not share request level information that includes the connecting IP address proxied by the Privacy Gateway service (“Privacy Gateway Request Data”) with Privacy Gateway customers.
- We will not combine any of the Privacy Gateway Request Data with any other Cloudflare service or third-party data in any way that can be used to identify individual end users.
